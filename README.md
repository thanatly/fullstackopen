## Content
This repository contains JavaScript and CSS files.
- Tutorials - apps made by following the course conent
- Part 0 - Fundamentals of Web apps
- Part 1 - Introduction to React

## Installation
### React
- I used *Homebrew* for React setup. See this [tutorial](https://www.techomoro.com/how-to-install-and-set-up-react-on-macos-x/).
- Since the files in Part 1-2 only contain source file, build react project and replace file in *src* folders with the content in each part. See [How to create a new React app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

## Usage
This repository is solely for personal use for excercises in Fullstack Open course at Helsinki University.
